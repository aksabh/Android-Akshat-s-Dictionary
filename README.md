		        	 Project Description
               
 		In this android app we have to create an application that takes 
	        a word as input and gives the meaning of it as output. 
		


                 MainActivity.java

                This .java file is the main file in which the object of the 
                Thread is created and the thread created by me is accessed.
		It has the following functions:

		    public void onCreate(View view)
					
			This functions takes the input from the user and stores
		them in URL and search. When the user clicks on the test 
		button, the listener handler is executed and thread 
		object is created. This function also displays the output of
		the application.		

        	    public void onClear()

			  This function is called when the user clicks on the
		clear button which clears all the text fields and edit text
		fields.


                 


                          /////////////////////////////


                 activity_main.xml

		This .xml file is used to design the user interface of the 
		application. The layout for the application is relative and 
		I have used  buttons and text views for the interface.
